# server-components

An ultra-dumb component framework for server-side rendering, inspired by web components.

This is a proof of concept right now, to look at using web components for structure on the server-side, not just the client-side.

Going to be quite hacky, serious fully web-component compatible support is probably blocked on
https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1030, and I expect JSDom performance will block quite a bit of this for any serious use
for quite a while.
