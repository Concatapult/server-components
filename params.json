Many of us have been doing so not because our sites need to because server side rendering isn't enough to deliver our core experience, but because JS frameworks offer the best developer experience.\r\n\r\nTools like React, Ember, Angular and friends make building web pages a delight. That's because they've been in a great place to discover and develop better approaches to building and managing UI complexity though, not because they're running client-side. We've conflated the two.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this. We can take those same ideas and designs (critically, the key element they all agree on: composing applications together from many standalone elements), and get the magic and maintainability on the server side too, without the costs.\r\n\r\nServer Components is an attempt to do that, by supporting the [Web Components spec](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/) (the W3C work to pull out the core magic of these frameworks into an official standard), when rendering HTML in server-side Node.js.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n\r\n<social-media-meta-tags name=\"My Profile Page\" image=\"./social-media-image.png\" ></social-media-tags>\r\n\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<h1>My Profile Page</h1>\r\n\r\n<social-media-icons twitter=\"pimterry\" github=\"pimterry\" />\r\n\r\n<google-map latitude=\"41.390205\" longitude=\"2.154007\"></google-map>\r\n\r\n<item-feed id=\"minor-events\">\r\n    <twitter-source username=\"pimterry\" />\r\n    <github-source  username=\"pimterry\" type-filter=\"PullRequestEvent\" />\r\n</item-feed>\r\n\r\n<item-feed id=\"manually-curated-content\">\r\n    <manual-source icon=\"./blog-icon\"    source=\"blog-posts\" />\r\n    <manual-source icon=\"./talk-icon\"    source=\"talks-given\" />\r\n    <manual-source icon=\"./project-icon\" source=\"project-events\" />\r\n</item-feed>\r\n\r\n<item-carousel>\r\n    <speakerdeck-source icon=\"./slides-icon\" />\r\n    <manual-source      icon=\"./slides-icon\" source=\"slidesets\" />\r\n</item-carousel>\r\n\r\n<item-carousel>\r\n    <manual-source icon=\"./video-icon\" source=\"talk-videos\" />\r\n    <manual-source icon=\"./photo-icon\" source=\"talk-photos\" />\r\n</item-carousel>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic to write websites like the above, render it on the server, and serve up your users a fully populated page the works in browsers from the dawn of time, takes no mountain of JS to run, renders at lightning speed, and that search engines and screen readers can effortlessly understand.\r\n\r\nCode like this is a pleasure to write, clicking abstractions together to build incredible applications at high-speed, but right now it happens only on the client side. If you render this server side though, you can get the power of this, and the benefits of just serving static HTML + CSS (and more JS too, if you like, to progressively enhance your site with extra interactivity as well).\r\n\r\nYou can do this right now with Server Components. It's somewhere between a classic JavaScript framework (but much smaller, faster, simpler, and server-side) and a templating library (but much cleverer, more powerful and more flexible).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't end there though. The end goal of this is to provide an API so close to the client-side web component standard that it becomes easy to write components which work on both sides, enabling isomorphic JavaScript entirely on web standards. It's server side only for now, but watch this space.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nServer Components is building on the Web Components specs, but really almost entirely the custom elements spec. HTML Imports are out of scope initially (although it's interesting to think about what that might look like on the server), template tags are supported but are unnecessary really since all DOM is inert here, and the Shadow DOM is challenging and less useful here, so not the main focus right now.\r\n\r\nCore DOM functionality now built on [Domino](https://github.com/fgnass/domino), so DOM manipulation comes with Domino's\r\nlimitations. File issues if you hit any of these, Domino is aiming to be an accurate representation of the full DOM spec, so there's any serious divergences should probably be fixable upstream.\r\n\r\nIE 8 and earlier render unknown elements poorly, and will probably render the output of this badly. This is [solvable by hand](https://blog.whatwg.org/supporting-new-elements-in-ie) (although it requires front-end JS), but isn't solved automatically for you here yet.\r\n\r\n## Basic Usage\r\n\r\n#### Component definition\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar components = require(\"server-components\");\r\n\r\n// Get the prototype for a new element\r\nvar NewElement = components.newElement();\r\n\r\n// When the element is created during DOM parsing, you can transform the HTML inside it.\r\n// This can be configurable too, either by setting attributes or adding HTML content\r\n// inside it or elsewhere in the page it can interact with. Elements can fire events\r\n// that other elements can receive to allow interactions, or even expose methods\r\n// or data that other elements in the page can access directly.\r\nNewElement.createdCallback = function () {\r\n    this.innerHTML = \"Hi there\";\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Register the element with an element name\r\ncomponents.registerElement(\"my-new-element\", { prototype: NewElement });\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor examples of more complex component definitions, with explanations, take a look at [component-examples.md](component-examples.md) (TODO)\r\n\r\n#### Component usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar components = require(\"server-components\");\r\n\r\n// Render the HTML, and receive a promise for the resulting HTML string.\r\n// The result is a promise because elements can render asynchronously, by returning\r\n// promises from their callbacks. This allows elements to render content from\r\n// external web services, your database, or anything else you can imagine.\r\ncomponents.render(`\r\n    <html>\r\n    <head></head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <my-new-element></my-new-element>\r\n    </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n`).then(function (output) {\r\n    // Output = \"<html><head></head><body><my-new-element>Hi there</my-new-element></body></html>\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## API Documentation\r\n\r\n### Top-level API\r\n\r\n#### `components.newElement()`\r\n\r\nCreates a returns a new custom HTML element prototype, extending the HTMLElement prototype.\r\n\r\nNote that this does *not* register the element. To do that, call `components.registerElement` with an element name, and options (typically including the prototype returned here as your 'prototype' value).\r\n\r\nThis is broadly equivalent to `Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype)` in browser land, and exactly equivalent here to `Object.create(components.dom.HTMLElement.prototype)`. You can call that yourself instead if you like, but it's a bit of a mouthful.\r\n\r\n#### `components.registerElement(componentName, options)`\r\n\r\nRegisters an element, so that it will be used when the given element name is found during parsing.\r\n\r\nElement names are required to contain a hyphen (to disambiguate them from existing element names), be entirely lower-case, and not start with a hyphen.\r\n\r\nThe only option currently supported is 'prototype', which sets the prototype of the given element. This prototype will have its various callbacks called when it is found during document parsing, and properties of the prototype will be exposed within the DOM to other elements there in turn.\r\n\r\nThis returns the constructor for the new element, so you can construct and insert them into the DOM programmatically if desired.\r\n\r\nThis is broadly equivalent to `document.registerElement` in browser land.\r\n\r\n#### `components.render(html)`\r\n\r\nTakes an HTML string, and returns a promise for the HTML string of the rendered result. Server components parses the HTML, and for each registered element within calls its various callbacks (see the Component API) below as it does so.\r\n\r\nUnrecognized elements are ignored. When calling the callbacks any returned promises are collected, and this call will not return until all returned promises have completed. If any promises are rejected, the render call will be rejected too.\r\n\r\n#### `components.dom`\r\n\r\nThe DOM object (components.dom) exposes tradition DOM objects (normally globally available in browsers) such as the CustomEvent and various HTMLElement classes, typically use inside your component implementations.\r\n\r\nThis is (very) broadly equivalent to `window` in browser land.\r\n\r\n### Component API\r\n\r\nThese methods are methods you can implement on your component prototype (as returned by `newElement`) before registering your element with `registerElement`. Implementing every method here is optional.\r\n\r\nAny methods that are implemented, from this selection or otherwise, will be exposed on your element in the DOM during rendering. I.e. you can call `document.querySelector(\"my-element\").setTitle(\"New Title\")` and to call the `setTitle` method on your object, which can then potentially change how your component is rendered.\r\n\r\n#### `yourComponent.createdCallback()`\r\n\r\nCalled when an element is created, with `this` set as the element itself. If you need the document you're being rendered into, use `this.ownerDocument`.\r\n\r\n**This is where you put your magic!** Rewrite the elements contents to dynamically generate what your users will actually see client side. Read configuration from attributes or the initial child nodes to create flexible reconfigurable reusable elements. Register for events to create elements that interact with the rest of the application structure. Build your page.\r\n\r\nIf this callback returns a promise, the rendering process will not resolve until that promise does, and will fail if that promise fails. You can use this to perform asynchronous actions without your component definitions. Pull tweets from twitter and draw them into the page, or anything else you can imagine.\r\n\r\nThese callbacks are called in opening tag order, so a parent's createdCallback is called, then each of its children's, then its next sibling element.\r\n\r\n#### `yourComponent.attachedCallback()`\r\n\r\nCalled when the element is attached to the DOM. This is different to when it's created when your component is being built programmatically, not through HTML parsing. *Not yet implemented*\r\n\r\n#### `yourComponent.detachedCallback()`\r\n\r\nCalled when the element is removed from the DOM. *Not yet implemented*\r\n\r\n#### `yourComponent.attributeChangedCallback()`\r\n\r\nCalled when an attribute of the element is added, changed, or removed. *Not yet implemented*.\r\n\r\n**So far only the createdCallback is implemented here, as the others are less relevant initially for the key simpler cases. Each of those will be coming in time though!

If you're just keen generally, pick up Server Components and go try to build\r\nsomething quick yourself now.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to dive into more specific development anyway, take a look at the Huboard at\r\nhttps://huboard.com/pimterry/server-components/ to see the currently prioritised issues and their\r\nstatus. If you'd like to pick one up, add a quick note on the ticket that you're interested and outlining\r\nyour approach, and then jump in!\r\n\r\n#### Building the project\r\n\r\nEverything you need should be installed after a clone and `npm install`. There's very few build scripts,\r\nbut they're managed just through NPM directly, take a look at the [package.json](package.json) for details.\r\n\r\nTo test the project: `npm test`\r\nTo watch the project locally and automatically run tests on changes: `npm run dev`",
